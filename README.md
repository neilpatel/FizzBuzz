# FizzBuzz Implementations

Fizzbuzz is a very basic programming task used in software engineering job interviews to determine if the candidate can actually write code in a particular language. 

This repository contains the implementation of FizzBuzz in various languages.

## Task
+ Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three (3) print "Fizz", multiples of five (5) print "Buzz", and for multiples of both three (3) and five (5) print "FizzBuzz" rather than printing the number.
